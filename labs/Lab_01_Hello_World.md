## Lab 1 - Hello World (Python)

### Task 1 - Accessing the Lab Environment

* Obtain your Public IP Address from the Course Instructor
  *  This is the public IP of your Linux jump host
  *  You will be able to access all network devices by name through this jump host when the network labs start

* You can access the jump host via SSH or RDP
* All credentials are ntc/ntc123


### Task 2 - Python Interpreter

##### Step 1

While in the course virtual machine, click the **Terminal** icon on the (desktop unless you've chosen to SSH to it.)

Once the command prompt (terminal window) opens, type in the word `python` and press `Enter`.

You will see the following prompt:

```python
ntc@ntc:~$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

```

##### Step 2

Once you're in the shell type `print 'Hello World!'`

```python
>>> print 'Hello World!'
Hello World!

```

This means you are now in the Python Interpreter and can immediately start programming in Python. Since Python is an interpreted language, there is no requirement to create a complete program in a file before the code is executed. You can just start programming.

This was just a short mini-lab to understand how to access the Python Interpreter.
